Assume that in 1995 US congress wanted to test out a new policy to reduce tobacco use.  They divided up the country and required only states ending with the letter A to implement the new policy.  
 
Using a modern programming language of your choice calculate the average percentage change of everyday smokers from 1995 to 1996 for the two groups of states (those ending in A and those not ending in A).
 
Steps:
1. Download CDC data file from: https://data.cdc.gov/Smoking-Tobacco-Use/BRFSS-Prevalence-and-Trends-Data-Tobacco-Use-Four-/8zak-ewtm
2. Calculate the average percentage change of everyday smokers from 1995 to 1996 for the two groups of states
3. Output the answer as follows:
  States ending in A: -1%
  States not ending in A: 3%
 
Note: You should exclude Puerto Rico, D.C. and states that start with Nationwide.
